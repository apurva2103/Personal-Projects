# Personal-Projects
Some of the projects that I have explored with during my Masters. 

About:
1. Analyzing Earthquakes with QGIS: Space/Time Analysis of Earthquake Activity was done using QGIS for the month of February 2020. TimeManager plugin was used to create the images using the Time controls. The video was created using a Python Script called 'make_video.py'. 
2. make_video.py: It is a Python script which creates the videos by using the images in a file and putting them together.
